# Testing on the Toilet: Change-Detector Tests Considered Harmful

This article was adapted from a [Google Testing on the Toilet](http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2007/01/introducing-testing-on-toilet.html) (TotT) episode. You can download a [printer-friendly version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13k8AsgYdF-2TJx9QIHHvPiuV3JMbsrMLkWmmjdYBLVg/edit?usp=sharing) of this TotT episode and post it in your office.*

You have just finished refactoring some code without modifying its behavior. Then you run the tests before committing and… a bunch of unit tests are failing. **While fixing the tests, you get a sense that you are wasting time by mechanically applying the same transformation to many tests.** Maybe you introduced a parameter in a method, and now must update 100 callers of that method in tests to pass an empty string.

**What does it look like to write tests mechanically?** Here is an absurd but obvious way:

    // Production code:
    def abs(i: Int)
      return (i < 0) ? i * -1 : i

    // Test code:
    for (line: String in File(prod_source).read_lines())
      switch (line.number)
        1: assert line.content equals "def abs(i: Int)"
        2: assert line.content equals "  return (i < 0) ? i * -1 : i"

**That test is clearly not useful**: it contains an exact copy of the code under test and acts like a checksum. **A correct or incorrect program is equally likely to pass** a test that is a derivative of the code under test. No one is really writing tests like that, but how different is it from this next example?

    // Production code:
    def process(w: Work)
      firstPart.process(w)
      secondPart.process(w)

    // Test code:
    part1 = mock(FirstPart)
    part2 = mock(SecondPart)
    w = Work()
    Processor(part1, part2).process(w)
    verify_in_order
      was_called part1.process(w)
      was_called part2.process(w)

It is tempting to write a test like this because it requires little thought and will run quickly. **This is a change-detector test**—it is a transformation of the same information in the code under test—and **it breaks in response to any change to the production code, without verifying correct behavior** of either the original or modified production code.

**Change detectors provide negative value**, since the tests do not catch any defects, and the added maintenance cost slows down development. These tests should be re-written or deleted.
